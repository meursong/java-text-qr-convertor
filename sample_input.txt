Application Error Log - Sample Data for QR Code Testing

========================================
Error Report ID: ERR-2025-1206-001
Timestamp: 2025-12-06 10:30:25 UTC
Application: TextQRConverter v1.0.0
Environment: Internal Network Server
========================================

ERROR: Database connection timeout
Stack Trace:
java.sql.SQLTimeoutException: Connection timed out after 30000ms
    at com.database.ConnectionPool.getConnection(ConnectionPool.java:245)

Context Information:
- User ID: 12345
- Session ID: sess_67890abcdef
- Request Type: GET /api/users/profile
- Server Load: 85%
- Memory Usage: 6.2GB / 8GB
- Database Pool Status: 12/15 connections active

Additional Debug Information:
This error occurred during peak usage hours when the database server was experiencing high load.
The connection pool was nearly exhausted, and new connections were timing out.
Investigation shows that several long-running queries were blocking the connection pool.

Recommended Actions:
1. Increase connection pool size from 15 to 25
2. Implement connection timeout retry logic
3. Optimize slow-running queries in the user profile module
4. Consider implementing database read replicas for load distribution

System Configuration:
- JVM Version: OpenJDK 11.0.16
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS
- Database: PostgreSQL 13.8
- Connection Pool: HikariCP 5.0.1
- Max Heap Size: 8192MB
- Current Heap Usage: 6291MB (77%)

This sample data demonstrates various types of text content that developers typically need to transfer:
- Structured error logs with stack traces
- Configuration parameters and system metrics
- Diagnostic information and troubleshooting steps
- JSON-like data structures and technical specifications

The text-to-QR converter should handle this mixed content efficiently, preserving formatting
and ensuring data integrity through checksums and error correction.
